# Product demo flow

## Incremental, demonstrating wishlist in other arc

### Setup wish list

As user who receives gifts, e.g. Claire:

 * Open new Arc, e.g. on    https://polymerlabs.github.io/arcs-cdn/dev/app/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fseefeldb.github.io%2Farc-stories%2Fartifacts%2FProducts%2Frecipes.manifest
 * Accept "Show Product List and Choose from Product List (Book: How to Draw and 2 other items)"
 * Add at least one product
 * Click the lock icon in the header to share this arc

### Gift shopping, discovering Arrivinator, the wishlist and manufacturer particles

As user gifting (needs to be different than user above):

 * Open new Arc, e.g. on https://polymerlabs.github.io/arcs-cdn/dev/app/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fseefeldb.github.io%2Farc-stories%2Fartifacts%2FProducts%2Frecipes.manifest
 * Accept "Show Product List (Minecraft Book and 2 other items) and Buy gifts for Claire's {occasion} in {timeframe} and Estimate arrival dates for Product List"
 * Accept "Choose from Products recommended based on ..."
 * Accept "Check manufacturer information for Product List (Minecraft Book and 2 other items) and Poweronics manufacturer information Product List"

## Original flow, with default wishlist (standalone)
